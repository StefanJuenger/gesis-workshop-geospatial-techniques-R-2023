In the addon of the session, we calculated the distances to the closest hospitals located within North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW) and Baden Wurttemberg (BW). Still, we did not show how to subset the original file, which contains all hospitals in Germany.

Subset the data file yourself by relying on the spatial information of the file `hospital_points.csv` and a polygon of NRW only.
How many hospitals are located within the borders of NRW?
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You need two datasets for that: the point layer `hospital_points.csv` in the `./data` folder and polygons of NRW. For the latter, you can again use the `osmdata` syntax.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The default of `sf::st_join()` will leave you with a 'left-join' and returns a data object with all hospitals and matching district information for those which are located within NRW. You can reset the option to perform an 'inner-join' and keep only the observation which lay within the predefined area (`sf::st_join(x , y, join  = "", left = FALSE)`).

```

```{r first, solution = TRUE}
# load hospitals
hospitals <- 
  read.csv(
    "./data/hospital_points.csv", 
    header = TRUE, 
    fill = TRUE, 
    sep = ","
  ) %>%
  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("X", "Y"), crs = 3035)


#  use the OSM function
nrw <-
  osmdata::getbb(
    "Nordrhein-Westfalen", 
    format_out = "sf_polygon"
  ) %>% 
  .$multipolygon %>% 
  sf::st_transform(3035)

# spatial join
nrw_hospitals <-
  hospitals %>% 
  sf::st_join(
    # point layer nrw
    nrw, 
    # chose intersect or within
    join = sf::st_intersects,
    # option FALSE will 
    # keep only the hospital 
    # which could be joined
    left = FALSE
  )

nrw_hospitals
# 344 hospitals in NRW
```


```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Did the operationalization of health care provision convince you? Don't you think it might be more important how many hospitals are close to survey respondents?
To test this, we want to calculate the number of hospitals per district in North-Rhine Westphalia.
Use the syntax below to prep the hospital data.

Earn extra points by counting not only the number of hospitals but also the sum of hospital beds within a district.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You need a `dplyr::as_tibble()` data frame to use the functions `dplyr::group_by()` and `dplyr::summarise()`.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The function `dplyr::n()` allows summarizing the total count of hospitals. `sum(beds)` for summarizing the bed total per district.
```

```{r second, solution = TRUE}
nrw_districts <- 
  sf::read_sf("./data/VG250_KRS.shp") %>% 
  sf::st_transform(3035) %>% 
  sf::st_join(nrw, join = sf::st_intersects, left = FALSE)

nrw_hospitals <-  
  nrw_hospitals %>% 
  # beds were character, now numeric
  dplyr::mutate(beds = as.numeric(beds)) %>%
  # replace NAs as zeros for simplification
  replace(is.na(.), 0)

district_hospital_join <-
  nrw_hospitals %>% 
  # join the hospitals 
  # within districts
  sf::st_join(nrw_districts, join = sf::st_within) %>% 
  # use as tibble to perform
  # group by & summarise
  dplyr::as_tibble() %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(AGS) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    hospital_count = dplyr::n(), 
    hospital_bed_count = sum(as.numeric(beds))
  ) %>% 
  # left join the new information
  # to the original data frame
  dplyr::left_join(nrw_districts, .)

district_hospital_join 
```
