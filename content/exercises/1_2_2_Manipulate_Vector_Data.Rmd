Import the ESRI shapefile of German districts and the district attribute table.
Join the two data frames, transform the CRS to `EPSG:3035` and check your changes. 
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You need to rename one of the id variables or adjust your join accordingly (`AGS = district_id`).
```


```{r first-exercise, solution = TRUE}
# load libraries
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

# Import data
german_districts <- 
  sf::read_sf("./data/VG250_KRS.shp") %>% 
  dplyr::rename(district_id = AGS)

attributes_districts <- readr::read_csv("./data/attributes_districts.csv") 

# Join data and transform
german_districts_enhanced <- 
  german_districts %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(attributes_districts, by = "district_id") %>% 
  sf::st_transform(3035)

# Check
sf::st_crs(german_districts_enhanced)

head(german_districts_enhanced, 2)
```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
We want a first descriptive visual of the distribution of Covid-19 deaths in Mannheim and the surrounding districts. 
Calculate the number of Covid-19 deaths (`death_rate`) by population (`population`) and multiply with 100,000. 

Filter the district of Mannheim (`district_id == "08222"`), find the surrounding districts, and plot Mannheim and its surrounding districts.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You can use the dplyr function `sf::bind_rows()` to combine the two spatial objects, "Mannheim" and "Mannheim Surroundings".
```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE}
# calculate Covid-19 rate
german_districts_enhanced <-
  german_districts_enhanced %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(covid_deaths_pop = (death_rate / population) * 100000)

# filter Mannheim
mannheim <-
  german_districts_enhanced %>% 
  dplyr::filter(district_id == "08222")

# filter surrounding districts, append with Mannheim data and select the Covid column
mannheim_sur <-
  german_districts_enhanced %>%
  dplyr::filter(lengths(sf::st_touches(., mannheim)) > 0) %>% 
  dplyr::bind_rows(mannheim) %>%   
  dplyr::select(covid_deaths_pop)

# plot  
plot(mannheim_sur)
```

```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Save your data set of Mannheim and its surrounding districts as an ESRI Shapefile. 
```

```{r third-exercise, solution = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Export as shapefile
sf::st_write(
  cologne_sur, 
  dsn = "./data/participant_materials/mannheim_covid19_epsg3035.shp", 
  delete_layer = TRUE
)
```
