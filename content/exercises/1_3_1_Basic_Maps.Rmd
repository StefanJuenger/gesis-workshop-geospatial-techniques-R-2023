```{r knitr_init, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, include=FALSE}

  clues = list(box.title = "Clues",
               box.body = list(fill = "#fff9dc", colour = "black"),
               box.header = list(fill = "#ffec8b", colour = "black"),

We've finally arrived at creating our first maps based on the data we imported and cleaned in the previous sessions.
The focus of this first session lies on the package `tmap` to create maps.

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Let's start super simple.
Import our enhanced district data.
Create a map with only the outline of Germany and one where the districts' borders are visible.
Chose a color of your choice for both maps.
```

```{r first.exercise, solution = TRUE}
# load libraries
library(tmap)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

# code based on the original
german_districts <- 
  sf::read_sf("./data/VG250_KRS.shp") %>% 
  dplyr::rename(district_id = AGS)

attributes_districts <-  readr::read_csv("./data/attributes_districts.csv") 

german_districts_enhanced <- 
  german_districts %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(attributes_districts, by = "district_id") %>% 
  sf::st_transform(crs = 3035)


# start by setting the tmap mode to "plot" for static maps
tmap_mode("plot")   # interactive maps can be designed by changing the mode to "view"

# first maps based on geometrc features
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + # call  the shapefile first
  tm_fill(col = "lightgrey") # fills the polygons without drawing borders

# ... or use tm_polygons
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "lightblue") # fills the polygons and draws borders
```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
In a second step, we want to visualize some information on the German districts contained in the attribute table.
Choose the column `death_rate` and create a map of Covid-19 deaths in Germany.
Alternate the map by:

- add a legend title and change the color palette
- add a title to the map and change the font color of the title
- place the legend outside of the map at the bottom
- ...

Assign your map to an object called `covid_map`.
```


```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
Combine the following options with a plus sign:

- add a legend title and change the color palette: `tm_fill(col = "", title = "", palette = "") +`
- add a title to the map and change the font color of the title: `tm_layout(title = "", title.color = "") +`
- place the legend outside: `tm_legend(legend.outside = TRUE/FALSE, legend.outside.position = "")`

If you run `colors()`, R returns the names of all built-in colors.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
To assign your map to an object, use the arrow `<-`.
```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE}

# plot the covid-19 cases per 100.000 inhabitants
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_fill(col = "death_rate")                   # "col" can be the name of a color or a column name

# change the title of the legend and the color palette
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_fill(col = "death_rate",
          title = "Covid-19 Death Rate",    # add a title to the legend
          palette = "RdPu")                     # change the color palette

# add a title in the color blue
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_fill(col = "death_rate",
          title = "Covid-19 Death Rate",
          palette = "RdPu") +
  tm_layout(title = "Covid Deaths in Germany",        # alternate the overall layout like title
            title.color = "blue" )                   # changes the font color of the title

# place the legend outside of the map to the left
tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_fill(col = "death_rate",
          title = "Covid-19 Death Rate",
          palette = "RdPu") +
  tm_layout(title = "Covid Deaths in Germany",
            title.color = "blue" ) +
  tm_legend(legend.outside = TRUE,                  # positions the legend outside           
            legend.outside.position = "left")       # defines legend positions 

# save your map in an object called "covid_map"
covid_map <-  
  tm_shape(german_districts_enhanced) + 
  tm_fill(col = "death_rate",
          title = "Covid-19 Death Rate",
          palette = "RdPu") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Covid Deaths in Germany",
            main.title.color = "blue" ) +
  tm_legend(legend.outside = TRUE,
            legend.outside.position = "left") 
```
